# ADAM2024Challenge
Welcome to the ADAM2024 HPCC Systems and ECL Code Challenge!

## Introduction
1000 Children go missing every day in the United States. 1 in 6 become victims of human trafficking.

HPCC Systems has partnered with NCMEC (National Center for Missing and Exploited Children) to help notify first responders and law enforcement when a child is reported missing.

What can we do as developers to help understand this problem, and what can we do to help?

## The Challenge
Your challenge is to analyze different social factors such as poverty, unemployment, and other factors and develop insights and additional information for the first reponders.

## The Data
NCMEC Data has been collected from all 50 states and organized into a simple dataset to use as your central source.

In addition, many public datasets have also been gathered and cleaned to help get you started.

These datasets include:

**Education**

**Unemployment**

**Poverty**

**Population**

**Shelters**

Auxiliary Datasets: A **Cities** dataset with related FIPS and Zip Codes

More to come...
